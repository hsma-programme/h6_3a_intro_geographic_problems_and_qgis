## Additional QGIS Reference Materials

A reference guide for some of the QGIS skills we're going to learn today can be found here: https://github.com/hsma-programme/5c_geo_vz_qgis/blob/main/200824_QGIS_training_with_PenCHORD.pdf

(note that the linked document accompanied an older version of this module; it covers some of the concepts we'll be doing in session 2B as well, and covers a different method of creating a basemap, so some elements may vary)

## Learning Objectives

### Part 1: An Introduction to Geospatial Problems in Health

Students should be able to:

- Explain what kind of healthcare/policing/social care problems can be tackled using geospatial data (routing, scheduling, location-allocation, general understanding of your service users)
- Give real-world examples are there of these techniques being applied to the kind of problems HSMAs are likely to tackle
- Know what common problems encountered with these kinds of tasks (regional borders, raw vs standardised demand, limits of force)
- Explain the following geographical terms and concepts: latitude, longitude, northing, easting, CRS, BNSSG, projection, OA, LSOA, MSOA, postcode, trust, ICB, choropleth
- Explain the reasons behind choosing different projections

### Part 2: Geographic Visualisation using QGIS

Students should be able to:

- Navigate QGIS and know the functions of the key tools
- Create a new project and set up a basemap and CRS
- Add point data stored in a delimited flat file (.csv) to a project
- Troubleshoot CRS issues and understand why a CRS may be chosen
- Filter point data via the query builder
- Show and hide categories of points from the layer panel
- Change the style of points (for all points or by a chosen data category)
- Import custom markers
- Add simple labels to points
